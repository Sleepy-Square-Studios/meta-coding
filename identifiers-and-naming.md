# Identifiers and Naming

- Prefer being verbose than being concise (e.g. through namespaces), in order to ensure clarity in names.
- Follow existing coding conventions that already work in other contexts (such as the standard library).
- When in doubt, check spellings in word processors/dictionaries/existing literature.
- Use terminologies that are appropriate for the audience.
