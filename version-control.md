# Version Control

- We follow the [Conventional Commits spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to ensure consistent description of commits.
  - It is advisable to use Conventional Commits to ease with further integrations of automated workflows concerning commits.
- Contributors should branch from the main branch for isolating their changes. They are expected to submit pull requests to introduce said changes to the projects.
- It is highly recommended to be verbose with the details on the commit messages as much as possible to properly contextualize changes.
- It is highly recommended for contributors to attach supporting screenshots/video recordings in their pull requests to aid with more accurate code reviews.
